    <PackageDescription>These extension methods for SQLitePCLRaw provide a more usable API while remaining stylistically similar to the sqlite3 C API, which most C# developers would consider 'ugly'.  This package exists for people who (1) really like the sqlite3 C API, and (2) really like C#.  So far, evidence suggests that 100% of the people matching both criteria are named Eric Sink, but this package is available just in case he is not the only one of his kind.</PackageDescription>
